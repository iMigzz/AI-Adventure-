2 types of AI 
*Narrow AI
  Also known as weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks with a high level of proficiency, such as facial recognition or language translation. It is considered “narrow” 
  because it lacks the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge beyond its programmed domain.
  
  Examples of narrow AI are numerous, and include voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, chatbots found in apps and on websites, and recommendation algorithms used by Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.

*General AI
  Or strong AI, is a theoretical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. There are 
  currently no examples of general AI systems, as the technology does not yet exist.
  
  Achieving this level of AI remains an ongoing and challenging area of research and will require a deeper understanding of consciousness and cognition.


Personal Takeaways- Pause here to consider how your daily interactions with data may be contributing to the larger AI ecosystem. It’s worth asking yourself questions like:

How is my data being used?
How do AI tools enhance or shape my daily experiences?
Am I making informed decisions about how much data I share?

Reflecting on these questions may offer further understanding of how to balance convenience with privacy to harness AI’s benefits responsibly.
